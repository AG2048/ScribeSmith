# ScribeSmith

## Abstract

The [report](docs/report/report.pdf) outlines an implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network** that attempts to generate realistic-looking images of handwritten text from ASCII text input along with a **text Recognizer** model. We present architecture, training, data, and a discussion of our model's qualitative and quantitative results on different datasets. The IAM handwriting Database is processed for training and validation, while the model is tested on a set of randomly generated and handwritten Shakespeare text. We also prepare baseline models for the recognizer and generator to gauge our primary model's performance. We also utilize **Fr√©chet Inception Distance** and **Character Error Rate** metrics to evaluate different sub-networks within the GAN. The final result of the project is a Generator that does not perform as expected, and a successful Recognizer. Potential ethical considerations for this project are also addressed.
